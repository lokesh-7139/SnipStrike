# SnipStrike â€“ Competitive Programming Battles & Practice Platform

This is the backend system for SnipStrike, a Codeforces-powered platform enabling competitive programming battles, personalized practice sessions, and real-time notifications. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and integrates the Codeforces API to deliver a seamless and scalable experience for programmers.

# Core Idea

SnipStrike is a backend system built to support a competitive programming platform powered by the Codeforces API. It enables users to participate in 1v1 coding matches and focused practice sessions, all while tracking performance and progress in real-time. The system handles match logic, filtered problem recommendations, session tracking, and real-time user engagement through notificationsâ€”building a fast, skill-based, and educational environment for programmers.
